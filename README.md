This project is a RESTful API built with Flask that implements user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). It includes CRUD operations for managing items in a SQLite database. The application features user registration and login, with protected endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting items. Flask-RESTful, Flask-SQLAlchemy, and Flask-JWT-Extended are used for building and securing the API.
